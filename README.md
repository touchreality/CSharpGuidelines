Coding Guidelines for C#
================

Theses guidelines provides coding standards, but also good coding practices that we have adopted at TouchReality.

[Basic Principles (AV0000)](_pages/0000_BasicPrinciples.md)

[Class Design (AV1000)](_pages/1000_ClassDesignGuidelines.md)

[Member Design (AV1100)](_pages/1100_MemberDesignGuidelines.md)

[Miscellaneous (AV1200)](_pages/1200_MiscellaneousDesignGuidelines.md)

[Maintainability Guidelines (AV1500)](_pages/1500_MaintainabilityGuidelines.md)

[Naming Conventions (AV1700)](_pages/1700_NamingGuidelines.md)

[Layout Guidelines (AV2400)](_pages/2400_LayoutGuidelines.md)

## To define...

Performance Guidelines (AV1800)

.NET Framework Usage (AV2200)

Comments and XML Documentation (AV2300)

## Notes
At TouchReality, we are currently in an adoption phase. It mean that the current rules are not strict but are welcomed.
We ask you to read them, practice them, discuss them together.

Nothing is writen in the stone, it is a working document that is intended to evolve.

To help you in this decision, Iâ€™ve assigned a level of importance to each guideline:

![](/assets/images/1.png) Guidelines that you should never skip and should be applicable to all situations

![](/assets/images/2.png) Strongly recommended guidelines

![](/assets/images/3.png) May not be applicable in all situations

## Code Overview

The current section gives you a quick overview of our coding convention, of course it doesn't represents all the rules but gives you a quick entry point.
