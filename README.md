## Notes
At TouchReality, we are currently in an adoption phase. It mean that the current rules are not strict but are welcomed.
We ask you to read them, practice them, discuss them together.

Nothing is writen in the stone, it is a working document that is intended to evolve.

To help you in this decision, Iâ€™ve assigned a level of importance to each guideline:

![](/assets/images/1.png) Guidelines that you should never skip and should be applicable to all situations

![](/assets/images/2.png) Strongly recommended guidelines

![](/assets/images/3.png) May not be applicable in all situations
